Instructions to run experiments and get data for gnuplot:

1. run ./runscript with the necessary arguemnts. First argument dictates the type of paxos to be run, second argument is the number of client threads.

2. the output will be generated in folders named "run#" incrementing in number with each run.

3. run ./parse_out - first argument is the paxos variant, second is the name of the folder you want to mine data from. NB: Make sure you enter the right paxos variant in the argument, corresponding to which variant is in the run folder you choose. This is easy to verify: do an ls on the run folder you wish to mine. 

4. ./parse_out dumps latency and throughput data into a file. SCP this file over to your machine, run gnuplot on it.

5. to remove previous outputs, run ./clean
